  # Recovers the set of possible public keys from a {Signature} and the digest
  # that it signs.
  #
  # If you do not pass a block to `recover_public_key` then it returns an
  # Enumerator that will lazily find more public keys when needed.  If you
  # are going to iterate through the enumerator more than once, you should
  # probably convert it to an array first with `to_a` to save CPU time.
  #
  # If you pass a block, it will yield the public keys to the block one at a
  # time as it finds them.
  #
  # This is better than just returning an array of all possibilities, because
  # it allows the caller to stop the algorithm when the desired public key has
  # been found, saving CPU time.
  #
  # This algorithm comes from Section 4.1.6 of [SEC1 2.0](http://www.secg.org/download/aid-780/sec1-v2.pdf)
